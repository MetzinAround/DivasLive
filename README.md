 A single repo for all of the Divas Live Bot series by Chloe Condon and Pj Metz. Using [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to interact with the Twitter API. Much of the code used from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU) and then organized to benefit us and our purposes. ALl bots code are stored in a .env file you'll need in order to keep your API keys hidden.
