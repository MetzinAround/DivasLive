# DivasLive

 A single repo for all of the Divas Live Bot series by Chloe Condon and Pj Metz. Using [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) to interact with the Twitter API. Much of the code used from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RF5_MPSNAtU) and then organized to benefit us and our purposes. All bots' keys are stored in a .env file you'll need in order to keep your API keys hidden. For responses, users must tag the bot and use a secret word or series of emojis to make the function run. Currently hosted on Heroku.

 JustBotPaid has two functions. The first is to tweet every Friday at 5:30pm Eastern Time Zone. This tweet includes the video of NSYNC' performing their cover of "Just Got Paid" at the [2001 Billboards awards show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byuPyhx5Ytg). The second function is to tweet back at a user when they use "ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’°" emojis. When a user does this, JustBotPaid responds with a gif from the video for "Just Got Paid," but uses the [original version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl1mQASHc48) instead. .
